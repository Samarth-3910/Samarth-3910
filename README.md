<h1>Hey there, I'm Samarth!</h1>

### 💡 About Me

I'm Samarth Keshari, a **3rd Year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering** student at **GLA University**, captivated by the art of crafting intelligent and impactful solutions. My journey in tech is fueled by an insatiable curiosity, constantly exploring the dynamic intersections of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Web Development**.

### 🚀 My Approach

> *"From nobody to necessity — I build what the future will need before the world knows it does."*
>
> I’m not here to follow trends — I’m here to create what others haven’t imagined yet. Whether it's designing deeply human AI companions, pushing boundaries in generative art, or crafting games that feel alive, my work lives in the space between imagination and reality. With limited resources and limitless intent, I turn solo projects into smart systems — learning fast, building faster, and always aiming to outpace what's expected.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Here are some of the core technologies and frameworks I actively work with and explore:

*   **Languages:** `Python`, `Java`
*   **AI/ML Frameworks:** `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow`, `scikit-learn`
*   **Version Control:** `Git`
*   **Current Focus:** Deep diving into **Generative AI** and mastering the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
